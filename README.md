# United-States-Hate-Crimes-1991-2018-

## Objective

To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

## Context
For this Achievement, you’ll select your own data to analyze. You’ll first conduct an exploratory visual analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then, after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.
Data dashboards are an effective tool for presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. Your dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and should contain a curation of the key results you discovered throughout this Achievement. Not all of your results will fit into the dashboard—make sure to include any additional analyses you conducted in a GitHub repository.

## Analysis Criteria

You’ll conduct the following analyses throughout the Achievement (note that you won’t need to include all results in your final dashboard, just those that help tell your story):
* Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots);
* Geospatial analysis using a shapefile;
* Regression analysis;
* Cluster analysis;
* Time-series analysis;
* Analysis narrative and final results (presented in your dashboard).
